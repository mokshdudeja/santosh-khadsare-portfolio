# Moksh Dudeja — Comprehensive Profile and Portfolio Research Dossier

## Executive Summary and Research Scope

This dossier compiles verifiable, public information about Moksh Dudeja to inform portfolio development and hiring assessments. The research consolidates signals from his LinkedIn headline, GitHub profile, Google Cloud Skills Boost records, and organizational pages for companies and programs with which he is associated. It emphasizes verifiable, role-relevant details and flags gaps that require confirmation.

Across sources, Moksh presents as a Computer Science student and early-career technologist building exposure across web development, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), and cybersecurity. He is publicly visible as an intern focusing on web development and AI at Webhack Solutions, a Generative AI Engineer intern with AI Wallah, a Campus Ambassador role that is visible via headline signals and requires primary confirmation, and a participant in a structured 45‑day cybersecurity internship program with CyberZero.Club. These roles, combined with hands-on coursework completions on Google Cloud (attention mechanisms and image generation), and an active GitHub footprint, outline a learning trajectory that blends practical development with applied AI and security-minded thinking.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^6][^7][^9]

The scope of this dossier is limited to public information available as of October 30, 2025. All time-bound statements and “current” designations are referenced to this baseline.

### Research Methodology and Constraints

The research relied on primary platforms where Moksh maintains a presence and where organizations publish program details: LinkedIn (for headline and post signals), GitHub (for code footprint and skills), Google Cloud Skills Boost (for verifiable course completions and badges), and organizational pages for Webhack Solutions, AI Wallah, CyberZero.Club, and DPG Degree College. Where possible, information was cross-verified across multiple sources. Some sites presented access constraints, including LinkedIn’s authwall for detailed profile content and Crunchbase’s Cloudflare verification screen for the Webhack Solutions profile. As a result, specific dates and scope for certain affiliations, along with enrollment details at DPG Degree College, are treated as provisional and flagged for confirmation.[^5]

### Trust and Verification Framework

We distinguish between signals and formal verifications:

- Headline and post signals on LinkedIn are considered public indicators of role association and intent but require primary confirmation (offer letter, HR email, or official roster) to be treated as fully verified.
- Google Cloud Skills Boost completions and badges are treated as verified achievements because they are issued directly by Google Cloud and surfaced on its public profile.[^3]
- Company and program pages are used to validate organizational existence and program structure; they corroborate the ecosystem in which Moksh operates.
- GitHub is used to evidence active learning and technology exposure; starred repositories and personal highlights are treated as self-reported signals unless tied to external validation.

Additionally, while GitHub demonstrates active learning, repositories would benefit from clearer documentation and live demos to strengthen portfolio narratives.

### Proposed Portfolio Positioning

Position Moksh as an early-career AI/ML enthusiast and web developer with demonstrated commitment to structured learning and hands-on experimentation. The portfolio should emphasize Google Cloud badges, concise project case studies, and security-minded web app demos, all framed around clarity of problem definition, architecture choices, and measured outcomes. Keep claims conservative and cite badges and repositories directly. As primary verifications arrive (offer letters, rosters, enrollment records), update the “Experience” and “Education” sections accordingly.

### Information Gaps Noted

- LinkedIn detailed profile content is behind an authwall; role scope and dates require direct confirmation.
- Perplexity Campus Ambassador role lacks an official announcement or program page reference.
- Specific dates, scope, and verification for the AI Wallah Generative AI Engineer Intern role are pending.
- Webhack Solutions company details were inaccessible due to Crunchbase’s verification screen; only LinkedIn presence could be used.
- Enrollment confirmation for DPG Degree College (program and intake year) requires primary documentation.
- Certifications list (AI, Copilot, Prompt Engineering, Image Generation, Attention Mechanism) requires primary proof; two are verified via Google Cloud.
- Quantitative achievements (deployment success rates, engagement increases, event attendance) require corroborating artifacts.

### Concluding Guidance

To present a credible, high-signal portfolio:

- Lead with verified badges and concise project case studies.
- Confirm roles with primary documents and update timelines.
- Tie GitHub work to clear READMEs and demos to demonstrate applied proficiency.
- Position the skill narrative as “emerging with structured learning,” aligning with roles that value prototyping, clear communication, and iterative growth.
